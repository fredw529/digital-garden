> ... the future isn't fixed; it's constructed every day by the actions of people

This book, in part, was another inspiration for starting this project. 

My takeaway from this book is that we should not be afraid of the uncertainty of the future because we have agency over it. I hope that I have instilled this idea to you by the time you are old enough to read this page so that it is obvious to you. Believe it or not, it took me a long time to accept my agency over my future.

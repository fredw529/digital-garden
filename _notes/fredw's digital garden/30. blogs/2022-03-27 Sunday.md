Hi Owen,

Today marks the first week your mom and I moved into our own place. You made this possible. Both of us were stressed out about forming a new routine, but interestingly, a new routine developed quite quickly and we both adapted to the change of environment. 

We spent today walking around Serramonte Mall in Daly City looking for a crib, car seat, and a stroller for you. You mom and I both got sticker shock over how much baby supplies cost. We had no idea things were so expensive. 

We'll meet in about 2 weeks!

Love,

Dad

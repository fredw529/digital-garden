Hi kid,

Exciting day today! We got the keys to the new place and will start moving in today.

Your grandparents and I got into an argument last night, though. They worry about us. I know they meant well, but their idea of helping was different from mine. I'd like to think that I am a pretty easygoing person. However, there is something about dealing with my parents that just makes me lose my mind. Maybe it has to do with trying to break out of their control?

I wonder what our relationship will be like. We will have our bad days, but I hope we'll get along well for the most part. I just want you to be a healthy, happy boy.

Love,

Dad

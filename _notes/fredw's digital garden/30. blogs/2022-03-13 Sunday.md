Hi Kid,

I think we are pretty much set on naming you Owen. 

We spent the last week setting the new place up. The most difficult task somehow was assembling the bed. Since the important furniture are all there now, we can finally move in soon, which marks the beginning of our little family.

Your expected birthday is sometime within the next 30 days. We all can't wait to meet you.

See you soon!

Love,
Dad

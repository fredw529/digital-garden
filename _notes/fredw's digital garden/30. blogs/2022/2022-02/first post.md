Hi Kid,

We'll meet in a couple of months.

This project is set up for you. There is so much you're going to have to learn about this world, and I thought it would be a neat idea to give you a leg up by putting together everything that *I* have learned accessible for you all in one place.

I decided to turn this into a website with the hope that someone else might find whatever information eventually available here helpful. Afterall, what's the point of learning so much if we're not willing to share it?

Right now, your mom and I are about to move in to our first place together. A flat rented from a friend of my boss. We are both working hard to build a foundation for your arrival.

See you soon!

Love,
Dad
